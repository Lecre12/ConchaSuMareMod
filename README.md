# Goofy ahh audio +
With this mod, when a crew memeber dies from falling damage or falling to the void, a new sound will apear.
If you want to feel like Kirbi when you fall in to the void because you are very bad at the parkour, just download this mod.

- Demo: https://youtu.be/2xMFHflv87E

# Installation
1. Install BepInEx
2. Drop the DLL and all the stuff inside of the BepInEx/plugins/ folder or create a new folder and put the stuff inside (all together).
3. Run the game and Enjoy :)
4. Try to not fall int to the void, don't be like Kirbi ;)

- If you want to use another sound when someone falls to death, just change the audio in the files to a custom one. Just make sure that the name of the file is: "CONCHA" and the termination .wav
